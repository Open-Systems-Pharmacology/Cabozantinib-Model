# Cabozantinib-Model
Cabozantinib PBPK

## Repository files
Within this repository we share whole body PBPK model of the TKI Cabozantinib with enterohepatic recirculation (EHC) and drug-drug-interaction (DDI) via CYP3A4 inducer. The model was developed using available pharmacokinetic studies. The model describes the EHC and the DDIs with Rifampin as CYP3A4 inducer.

For a detailed documentation of model development, quantitative model evaluation and sensitivity analysis, please refer to [[1]](#references).
